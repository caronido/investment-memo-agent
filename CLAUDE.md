## Project Overview

**memo-agent** is an AI-powered pipeline that generates structured investment memos from founder call transcripts for Nido Ventures, an SPV network investing in early-stage companies across the US and Latin America. The system follows a three-call evaluation process (Founder Story → Product Deep Dive → GTM Validation), extracting structured data from each call, identifying gaps, generating/updating a memo draft, and evaluating output quality.

The interface is a Slack bot triggered on-demand with `/memo [company]`.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.11+
- Anthropic Claude API (claude-sonnet-4-20250514 for pipeline, claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 for evals)
- Slack Bolt for Python (slash commands, Block Kit formatting)
- Attio REST API (CRM data, transcripts, decks)
- pytest for unit tests
- JSON file-based state management (per company)

## Architecture

The pipeline runs in four stages per call:

```
Transcript → [1. Extract] → [2. Gap Analysis] → [3. Memo Gen] → [4. Eval]
                                                        ↑
                                              Previous memo draft
                                              (for calls 2 and 3)
```

Each stage is a separate Claude API call with a specialized system prompt. Stages communicate through JSON schemas defined in `schemas/`. The pipeline orchestrator (`src/pipeline.py`) chains them together.

For multi-call flows, `src/state/manager.py` persists accumulated data per company in a `state.json` file. Each call's extraction merges with prior extractions, and the memo generator receives the existing draft for updating.

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Evals are built alongside features, not after.** Every module has a corresponding eval suite. Prompt changes are validated against the eval suite before being committed.
2. **Three eval types per module:** Programmatic (schema, type checks, known facts), LLM-as-judge (qualitative scoring on rubric), and human review (Renata validates quality).
3. **Bilingual handling:** Transcripts may be in Spanish, English, or a mix of both. Extraction normalizes to English. The memo output is in English.
4. **Human-in-the-loop:** The agent drafts; the investment team reviews. The system never makes autonomous investment decisions.
5. **Source attribution:** Every extracted data point tracks its source (transcript, deck, financial model) for traceability.

## Memo Template Sections

The investment memo follows this structure. Each section maps to a primary call stage:

| Section | Primary Call | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Executive Summary | 1 | Deal terms, structure, check size, valuation |
| Investment Thesis | 1 | Why this is a compelling opportunity |
| Team & Founders | 1 | Background, founder-market fit |
| Problem Statement | 1-2 | Industry pain point and status quo |
| Product & Technology | 2 | What they've built, tech stack, defensibility |
| Business Model | 2 | Revenue model, unit economics, pricing |
| Market Analysis | 1-2 | TAM/SAM/SOM, bottom-up sizing |
| GTM Strategy | 3 | ICP, sales cycles, champions, willingness to pay |
| Competitive Landscape | 2-3 | Competitors, differentiation, right to win |
| Traction & Metrics | 3 | Client list, KPIs (CAC, LTV), growth |
| Financial Review | 3 | Financial model assessment with call data |
| Concerns & Challenges | 1-2-3 | Risks, red flags, open questions |
| Scoring Rubric | 3 | Team, market, product, model, traction, competition scores |

## Three-Call Process

**Call 1 (Founder Story):** Founder background, business model, traction, ICP, round dynamics. Requests: cap table, financial model, market sizing, competitive landscape, incorporation docs.

**Call 2 (Product Deep Dive):** Industry status quo, product demo, technical architecture, unit economics. Requests: tech memo, product roadmap, hardware memo if applicable.

**Call 3 (GTM Validation):** ICP reasoning, sales cycles, champions, willingness to pay, competitive strategy, stickiness. Requests: client list, sales metrics (CAC, LTV).

## Session Log

Track what was built, what was learned, and what to carry forward.

| Session | What Was Built | Key Learnings | Eval Scores |
|---------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| 0 | Scaffolding | Not applicable | Not applicable |
| 1 | Implemented transcript extraction | Added a new schema for call 4 and updated the extractor to handle it. This allows for more flexible extraction of data from calls that don't fit the standard 3-call sequence and handles the case when there are more than 3 calls. | Not applicable |
| 2 | Extraction eval suite: extraction_judge.py (LLM-as-judge with Haiku), eval_extraction.py (programmatic + judge + runner with summary table), ground truth for Lazo call 1, baselines.json | Flexible GT matching (substring/contains) works well for varied extraction wording. Pre-computed extractions speed up eval runs. | Call 1: 10/10 programmatic, 4.0/5 judge. Call 2: 4/4 programmatic, 4.0/5 judge |
| 3 | Prompt variants (v1 straightforward, v2 analyst persona, v3 chain-of-thought) + A/B test script. Updated all prompts: bilingual support (not Mexico-specific), angel syndicate (not VC fund). v1 wins, set as default. | Simpler prompts outperform persona/CoT variants on signal-to-noise. GT pricing signals need flexible matching (35 not 35,000). | v1: 4.17 avg, v2: 4.0 avg, v3: 3.83 avg |
| 4 | Gap analysis module: analyzer.py + prompts.py with call-stage-aware question generation. After Call 1 focuses on product/tech for Call 2, after Call 2 focuses on GTM for Call 3, after Call 3 only remaining items. | Call-stage-aware prompting produces specific, non-generic questions grounded in actual extraction data. Memo template section definitions are key context for gap identification. | Lazo Call 1: 12 questions, 6 doc requests, 5 data quality flags |
| 5 | Gap analysis evals: eval_gap_analysis.py (programmatic + judge), gap_judge.py (specificity, stage-appropriateness, usefulness). 8 programmatic checks including stage targeting and doc alignment. | Keyword-group matching works better than exact phrases for doc alignment. Stage targeting check (60% threshold) catches misaligned questions. | Lazo Call 1: 8/8 programmatic, 5.0/5 judge (spec=5, stage=5, use=5) |
| 6 | Memo generator: generator.py + prompts.py (initial gen + update flow). Supports existing_memo param for multi-call updates. Updated all scope refs: Nido is an SPV network investing in early-stage companies across US and LatAm. | Section guide approach (WRITE vs TBD per call stage) produces well-structured memos. 8192 max_tokens needed for full memo output. | Lazo Call 1: 13 sections, 15 TBD placeholders, readable draft |
| 7 | Memo eval suite: memo_judge.py (4-dimension LLM judge), eval_memo.py (7 programmatic checks + judge), ab_test_memo.py (A/B test runner), prompt_variants.py (3 variants). v3 skeptical analyst wins, set as default. Added load_dotenv() fix to all judge files. | Skeptical analyst lens improves analytical quality (3.0→4.0) without hurting factual accuracy. Explicit "N/5" format instruction needed for scoring rubric compliance. Factual accuracy is the highest bar — winner sorted by fact first. | v3 winner: 4.5/5 overall (fact=5.0, tmpl=5.0, anal=4.0, comp=4.0). 7/7 programmatic. |
| 8 | End-to-end pipeline: src/pipeline.py (run_pipeline orchestrator with shared client, --skip-evals flag, file output), evals/eval_pipeline.py (cross-transcript pipeline eval runner with combined summary table). CLI for both modules. | Deferred eval imports keep --skip-evals fast. Progress to stderr / memo to stdout enables piping. Single shared Anthropic client across all stages avoids repeated init. | Pending live run |
| 9 | Multi-call state management: StateManager (JSON-backed per-company state), detect_contradictions (fuzzy field comparison), pipeline wiring (previous_extractions + existing_memo), eval_multicall.py (7 progression checks: TBD decreasing, all calls processed, content preservation, contradiction detection, memo growth, state file valid, memo versions stored). Added `from __future__ import annotations` for Python 3.9 compat. | State accumulation works via sorted calls_processed list. Fuzzy matching (strip $, commas, substring) needed for contradiction detection across varied extraction formats. `use_state` flag keeps backward compat for isolated runs. | Pending live run |
| 10 | Document ingestion: document_processor.py (PDF extraction via Claude vision with page-as-image and raw PDF fallback), merger.py (source-attributed field merge with discrepancy detection, k/m/b suffix-aware fuzzy matching), pipeline --documents flag, eval_ingestion.py (7 checks: enrichment gain, new fields, source attribution, combined sources, enrichment stats, discrepancy tracking, deck source type). | PDF-as-document fallback avoids pdf2image dependency. Scalar merge uses {value, source, page} attribution dicts. Array merge deduplicates by name for objects, by normalized value for scalars. Numeric suffix parsing (k/m/b) needed for cross-source fuzzy matching. | 7/7 programmatic (synthetic data) |
